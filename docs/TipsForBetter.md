# Getting the Hang of APIs in Python

This guide’s here to break down the basics of messing with APIs in Python. We’ll cover stuff like static methods, what APIs are, HTTP requests, JSON, endpoints, and a cool diagram showing how a project grabs data from an API, turns it into a Pandas DataFrame, and saves it as a CSV.

## Static Methods in Python

A **static method** is just a regular function that lives inside a class, tagged with the `@staticmethod` decorator. It doesn’t care about the class or its instances, so it’s not tied to `self` or `cls`. Think of it as a helper function that’s parked in the class for organization.

- **Why use it?** It’s great for utility functions that don’t need to poke around in class or instance data.
- **Example**: Check this out:

```python
class Example:
    @staticmethod
    def utility_function():
        return "Yo, this is a static method!"
```

There’s other decorators like `@classmethod` (for stuff that works on the class itself) or plain instance methods, but `@staticmethod` is your go-to when you want a function that’s just chilling in the class without needing extra baggage.

## What’s an API?

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is like a middleman that lets different apps talk to each other. It’s a set of rules and tools for swapping data, defining how you ask for stuff and what format you get it in.

### How APIs Work
```
End User (Browser) <=> API <=> Server (Backend System)
```

APIs are like bridges, making sure your Python script can chat with a server securely and smoothly.

### HTTP Methods for APIs
In Python, we usually use the `requests` library to hit up APIs. Here’s the main HTTP methods you’ll deal with:
- **GET**: Grab data from a server.
- **POST**: Send data to create something new on the server.
- **PUT**: Update stuff that’s already there.
- **DELETE**: Wipe out data on the server.

## Making API Requests in Python

To talk to APIs in Python, you’ll need the `requests` library. Get it with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Sample Code
```python
import requests

# Fire off a GET request
url = "https://api.example.com/data"
response = requests.get(url)
```

### Checking If It Worked
The `response.status_code` tells you if your request went through or bombed. Here’s the common codes:
- **200**: All good, request worked!
- **201**: Created something new on the server.
- **204**: Worked, but no data came back.
- **400**: Bad request, you messed something up.
- **401**: Unauthorized, probably a bad or missing API key.
- **500**: Server’s having a bad day (internal error).

For example, a 500 means the server hit a snag and couldn’t handle your request.

## Dealing with JSON

Most APIs spit out data in **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), a super common format that’s easy to work with. The `requests` library has a handy `.json()` method to turn that JSON into a Python dictionary.

### Example
```python
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
data = response.json()  # Turns JSON into a Python dict
```

## What’s an Endpoint?

An **endpoint** is just a specific URL that points to some resource in an API. It’s like the address you’re sending your request to.

### Pieces of an Endpoint
- **Protocol**: Usually `http://` or `https://`.
- **Domain**: The server’s address, like `api.example.com`.
- **Path**: The specific spot you’re hitting, like `/users` or `/products/123`.
- **Query Parameters**: Extra stuff like `?id=123`.
- **HTTP Method**: What you’re doing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Questions to Ask Yourself
To nail working with endpoints, think:
- What data am I after?
- Which HTTP method do I need?
- What parameters (like an API key) do I gotta include?

### Using API Keys
API keys are like your VIP pass for authentication. Toss them in the URL or headers.

```python
url = "https://api.example.com/data?api_key=your_api_key"
response = requests.get(url)
```
