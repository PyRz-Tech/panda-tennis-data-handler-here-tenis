## How to Get This Project Rolling

Yo, this project’s got a slick modular setup, so it’s super easy to tweak and build on.
I made sure to ditch hardcoding to keep things flexible and avoid headaches down the road.
Here’s the deal on how to get it up and running.

### Setting It Up
Getting this project going is a breeze:
1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project (`api_tennis_project/`). Pop your API key in there like this:
   ```plaintext
   API_KEY=*******************************************
   ```
   You can snag a free API key from [api-tennis.com](https://api-tennis.com/).

2. **Make a `tournament` folder** in the project root. That’s where your output CSV files will hang out.

3. **Plug in the API endpoint** in `src/api_client.py`. There’s a placeholder URL (`https://api-tennis.com/endpoint?API_KEY={self.api_key}`).Swap it out with the real endpoint from `api-tennis.com`’s docs. If you’re using a different API, just drop that endpoint in instead.

### Tweaking the JSON Validation
In `src/data_processor.py`, I set up the code to check if the JSON data from the API is legit, based on how `api-tennis.com` structures its responses (like checking for a `"success": 1` key). If you’re using a different API or the JSON structure’s different, peek at the API’s docs and tweak the `process_tournament_data` function to match. It’s built to be flexible, so you can adjust it without breaking a sweat.

### Why It’s Built This Way
The project’s modular as heck, with each piece handling one job (like API calls, data processing, or saving files). This makes it crazy easy to update or test. I skipped hardcoding stuff like endpoints or API keys to keep it clean and reusable. Plus, I threw in logging everywhere to help you debug if something goes wonky.

### Where to Learn More
I spilled all the tea on why I picked the tools and how I built this in the project’s docs. Check these out:

### Wrapping Up
This project’s designed to be a cinch to use and tweak. Just set up your `.env`, make the `tournament` folder, plug in the right endpoint, and you’re golden. If you’re using a different API, adjust the JSON validation in `data_processor.py` based on the API’s docs. The modular setup and no-hardcoding rule make it a breeze to work with, and the docs got your back for more details. Happy coding!
